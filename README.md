Exploratory Data Analysis
=========================

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to to the following:
* Download the scripts
* Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
* Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory
* Run the scripts

P.S. I removed the names of the X axis in plot 4 and fixed the names of the Y axis to make the graphs look more consistent, so my plots slightly differ from the ones in the description
